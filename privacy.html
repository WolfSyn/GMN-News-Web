      <strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 3, 2025
    </p>
    <p>
      GMN News does not collect or store any personal data from users. We use public, third-party APIs (e.g., GameSpot) to fetch and display gaming news. There is no user account or login requirement. If a future version of GMN News introduces features that collect personal data, this policy will be updated to reflect those changes.
    </p>
    <h2>Third-Party APIs</h2>
    <p>
      GMN News relies on publicly available APIs to retrieve news articles. We do not share any data with these services beyond standard API requests. For more information about how those third parties handle data, please consult their respective privacy policies.
    </p>
    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Since GMN News does not collect personal information, there is no personal data associated with you to access, correct, or delete.
